# What is Peri-Peri Sauce? Complete Guide to African Fire

Peri-peri sauce, also known as piri-piri sauce, is a spicy condiment that originated in Africa and has taken the culinary world by storm. This fiery sauce combines African bird's eye chilies with aromatic herbs and spices to create a complex, flavorful heat that enhances everything from grilled chicken to roasted vegetables.

## Origins and History

Peri-peri sauce traces its roots to Mozambique and Angola, where Portuguese colonizers first encountered the African bird's eye chili (Capsicum frutescens). The name "peri-peri" comes from the Swahili word for "pepper-pepper," reflecting the sauce's intense heat level.

## Key Ingredients

Traditional peri-peri sauce contains:
- African bird's eye chilies (the star ingredient)
- Garlic and onions for depth
- Lemon juice or vinegar for acidity
- Olive oil for richness
- Herbs like oregano and bay leaves
- Salt and sometimes sugar for balance

## Heat Level and Flavor Profile

Peri-peri sauce typically ranges from 50,000 to 175,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), making it significantly hotter than jalapeños but milder than habaneros. The flavor is complex, combining:
- Intense heat from the chilies
- Citrusy brightness from lemon
- Herbal notes from oregano and bay leaves
- Garlicky depth and richness

## Culinary Uses

### Grilled Chicken
The most famous application is peri-peri chicken, where the sauce serves as both marinade and finishing sauce.

# Scoville Scale Guide: Understanding Hot Sauce Heat Levels

The Scoville scale is the definitive measure of spiciness in peppers and hot sauces. Created by pharmacist Wilbur Scoville in 1912, this scale helps us understand and communicate heat levels, ensuring you can choose the perfect amount of spice for your palate. Let's explore this fiery world together.

## What is the Scoville Scale?

The Scoville scale measures the concentration of capsaicin, the compound responsible for the burning sensation in spicy foods. Originally measured through taste tests, modern methods use high-performance liquid chromatography for precise measurements.

### Scoville Heat Units (SHU)
- 0 SHU: No heat (bell peppers)
- 1,000-2,500 SHU: Mild heat
- 2,500-30,000 SHU: Medium heat
- 30,000-100,000 SHU: Hot
- 100,000-350,000 SHU: Very hot
- 350,000+ SHU: Extremely hot

## Popular Peppers and Their Heat Levels

### Mild (0-5,000 SHU)
**Bell Peppers (0 SHU)**
- No heat, sweet flavor
